he SAPS Service Complaints Centre, which forms part of the Component: Inspectorate Analysis Centre and Service Complaints at the Division Inspectorate, is in place to help the community to receive optimal service delivery and reduce complaints against the police. 

The aim of the process is to redress and investigate a dissatisfaction or disappointment experienced by any person or an organisation, locally, regionally, continentally, or internationally, in relation to an action or inaction regarding the service that was rendered or supposed to be rendered by the SAPS represented by its employee(s). 

Besides for complaints to be dealt with on an individual basis, an aggregation of all complaints is also done with a view to identify trends through analysis, of which the findings are then utilised to inform management to effect corrective action. 

Complaints can vary from poor service delivery regarding communication, response, investigations, police negligence, police misconduct and complaints against the SAPS Management or members and general complaints. 

For easy referral when reporting a complaint, the “Minimum complaint information” required includes, but is not limited to –

Full names and surname of the complainant; Identity number, residential/business address, telephone and cell phone numbers and email address. 

Also provide a description of the complaint including the province in which the complaint originated, the name of the police station, the case number (if applicable), details of the SAPS employees involved, etc. 

Complainants may submit a complaint directly by visiting your local police station community service centre (CSC), Station Commander, District / Cluster Commander’s office or Provincial Complaints Coordinators: Inspectorate.
